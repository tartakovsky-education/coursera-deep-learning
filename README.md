## Coursera / Deep Learning
Programming assignments for the [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

Jupyter Notebooks are read-only, as many dependencies can't be aquired for notebooks to be runnable.

The specialization has 5 courses in it. Following are the certificates for each:
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/TY4YP9CZCMTN)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/QD4TLHWDSW4K)
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/NS6A7X8LLCGS)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/ZBZQWZB3LVNH)
5. [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/ZJF4QZ82MF2D)

And the final [specialization certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/TYXAEXELNHLM).
